### Design Choices

The design is fairly simply, because you just have to combine the minimum and maximum algorithm.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n), because you just have to iterate once through the array

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1), because you just need to track the maximum and minimum (2 values)
