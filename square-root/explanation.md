### Design Choices

I used the binary search algorithm to find the square root of the given number. I also check if the number is negative,
because the square does not exist for negative numbers (in the set of Real numbers)

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(log n), because the binary search algorithms halves the problem size with each iteration.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1)
